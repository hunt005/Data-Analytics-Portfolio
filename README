# Data Analytics Portfolio

### About
Hi, my name is Hunter Wilson. I am currently attaining a Masters of Science in Business Analytics from The University of Alabama Huntsville (expected graduation in May 2024).

The majority of my work is in Python and R. The major focus of my projects and coursework involved predictive analytics and machine learning. Specific algorithms include regression, clustering, CART, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, various ensemble methods and text mining. Each of the examples below contain a file and description which showcases a homework, project or exam assignment where a certain machine learning or data analytics technique was used.
